Experiment 4: Combinational Circuit Design: RGB LED using K-Maps
This repository contains the RTL design, constraint file, and diagrams for a logic circuit implemented as part of Experiment 4.

Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a given combinational circuit. The design process involved:

RTL Design: Writing the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) description of the circuit using SystemVerilog.
Constraint File Creation: Developing a constraint file (XDC format for Xilinx, or appropriate format for your target FPGA) to guide the synthesis and place-and-route process for the FPGA. This file specifies timing constraints, pin assignments, and other crucial parameters.
Diagram Creation: Generating block diagrams and/or schematics to visually represent the circuit's architecture and data flow.
Files Included
Lab04.sv: SystemVerilog RTL code for the logic circuit.
Lab04_tb.sv: tenstBench for the systemVerilog RTL code.
constraints.xdc: Constraint file for the target FPGA.
Diagram.pdf: Block diagram of the circuit.
